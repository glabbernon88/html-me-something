            <p>In July of 2009, I took a memorable trip to Italy with my
            brother and his wife. We stayed in Lucca, a town in the Tuscan region, famous for its intact Renaissance&#8209;era
            city walls. The walls were originally built as protection from
            military invaders, but as they lost their military importance,
            the top of the walls became a pedestrian promenade.</p>

            <p>We stayed at <em>&quot;Villa Lavanda&quot;</em>, an 1800's era restored Italian villa, nestled in the hills outside of
            Lucca.</p>

            <p>We took several day trips, the first to Pisa to visit the Piazza del Duomo, home of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>

            <p>We followed that by a day trip to Florence. While there, we toured
            The Uffizi and  Galleria dell&rsquo; Accademia, museums home to famous works by Michaelangelo, Boticelli and many others, and did a walking tour of the
            city, including a stroll on the Ponte Vecchio.</p>

            <p>The highlight of the trip was a tour of the Ferrari factory in Maranello. We
            toured the museum, research and development (though they were
            fairly secretive in that area), viewed the production
            lines from start to finish: assembly lines, upholstery
            production, final painting, and watching them test drive the
            finished product (how do I apply for <em>that</em> job??!).  Definitely a once in
            a lifetime tour for me.</p>

            <p>We capped off the trip with a visit to a small local winery,
            having lunch overlooking the vineyards when we were done. It was
            the perfect ending to the trip, and made me eager to go back
            again soon.</p>
